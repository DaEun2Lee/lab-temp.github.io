Welcome to the N2SL! We study [Large-Scale Network Systems](https://n2sl-unist.github.io/n2sl/research/#large-scale-network-systems) and [Next Generation Wireless Networking and Sensing System](https://n2sl-unist.github.io/n2sl/research/#next-generation-wireless-networking-and-sensing-system). The lab was established in September 2019 in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at [UNIST](https://www.unist.ac.kr/).
