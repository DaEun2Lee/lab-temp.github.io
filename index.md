The Fong Lab is a team of scientist and engineerings seeking to understand how activity and experience driving plasticity in neural circuits.  Our goal is to harness knowledge of plasticity in the mammalian brain to develop treatments neurological disorders and to promote lifelong learning.  Toward this goal, we use a variety of approaches including electrophysiology, imaging, optogenetics, modeling, and control systems engineering.  Current work focuses on disability, rehabilitation, and learning in the central visual system.
