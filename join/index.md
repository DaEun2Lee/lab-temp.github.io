# Open Positions

The Fong Lab in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at Georgia Tech and Emory is hiring a research technician to help advance our studies on neural plasticity and visual rehabilitation in mice.  The technician will be responsible for conducting experimental and analytical work, as well as managing laboratory operations.  Research activities may include mouse handling, stereotaxic surgery, ocular manipulations, electrophysiology, optogenetics, computational analyses, euthanasia, and histology.  Operational work may include ordering supplies, managing mouse colonies, setting up equipment, maintaining websites, organizing data repositories, updating animal/safety protocols, coordinating outreach activities, and contributing to a positive and inclusive laboratory environment.  The technician will also participate in weekly lab meetings and individual meetings with the principal investigator.
 
The candidate should have a bachelor's degree in engineering or science by the time of employment, OR an equivalent combination of experience and training.  Ideal candidates will be organized, detail-oriented, and committed to learning beyond of oneâ€™s area of expertise.  Prior experience working with rodents, programming (in Python, MATLAB, or Bonsai), and/or experience working with common data standards (e.g. Neurodata Without Borders) should be highlighted in the application, but is not required.  The position is for full-time employment on the Georgia Tech campus, with a minimum commitment of 1 year.
 
Applicants should submit a resume/CV (1-2 pages), statement of interest (1 page), and contact information for 2-3 references to [ming-fai.fong@bme.gatech.edu](mailto:ming-fai.fong@bme.gatech.edu).   More information about the Fong Lab can be found at fong-lab.github.io.
 
Review of applications will begin in mid-January 2024, and will continue until the position is filled.


# Ongoing Opportunities

<!--### Staff Positions
Technician positions open up every 1-2 years.  If you are interested in learning about future opportunities or anticipated hiring timelines, please send an inquiry to [ming-fai.fong@bme.gatech.edu](mailto:ming-fai.fong@bme.gatech.edu).-->

### Postdoctoral scholars
Funding for various postdoctoral opportunities is available on a rolling basis.  Current funding is available for projects related to visual plasticity and optogenetic feedback control.  If you are interested our research, you are encouraged to send an inquiry and CV to [ming-fai.fong@bme.gatech.edu](mailto:ming-fai.fong@bme.gatech.edu).

### Graduate students
We accept graduate students who have already been admitted to one of the following programs: 

[Georgia Tech and Emory Joint Biomedical Engineering Program](https://bme.gatech.edu/bme/georgia-tech-emory-bme-phd-program) <br>
[Emory Neuroscience Program](https://biomed.emory.edu/PROGRAM_SITES/NS/) <br>
[Georgia Tech Bioengineering Program](https://bioengineering.gatech.edu/)
[Emory MD-PhD Program](https://med.emory.edu/MDPHD/)

**We cannot directly admit graduate students into our lab.** However, if you are interested in our research, we encourage you to apply to one (or more) of the programs above.  On your application, you can list our lab as one that interests you.  If you are invited for an interview, please reach out and we will try our best to be placed on your interview schedule.  If you are offered admission and want to learn specific details about ongoing projects or joining the lab for your PhD studies (or a research rotation), please contact [ming-fai.fong@bme.gatech.edu](mailto:ming-fai.fong@bme.gatech.edu).

Graduate students considering joining the Fong Lab (or any neuroscience/neuroengineering lab) are strongly encouraged to enroll in the following courses:
- Georgia Tech BMED 7610 Quantitative Neuroscience (Fall only)
- Emory IBS 526 Neuroanatomy and Systems Neuroscience (Fall only)
- Emory IBS 514 Cellular, Developmental, Molecular, and Translational Neuroscience (Spring only)

Please keep the registration deadlines and cross-registration deadlines in mind.

### Undergraduate students
If you are interested in working in the lab, please fill out the [Undergraduate Research Interest Form](https://forms.office.com/r/QD7qYbh2Et).  We encourage you to fill out this form (rather than to email us directly) to demonstrate that you have read through our website and understand the expectations for undergraduate researchers in our lab.  When positions become available, lab personnel will look through the form responses to identify candidates whose interests and goals align best with their research projects.  At that time, they will reach out to candidates directly to request additional materials (e.g. resume) and schedule interviews.  This communication typically occurs 1-2 months prior to the start of the semester, with hiring occuring at the beginning of the semester.

# Informal Mentorship

Mentorship can come in many forms, and you do not need to be a member of the Fong lab or interested in our research to seek support.  Ming-fai is open to chatting with students and postdocs on a range of topics (e.g. choosing a lab, career advice, imposter's syndrome, sexual harassment, responsible conduct of research, forming a thesis committee, etc).  Feel free to get in touch with Ming-fai if you would like to talk.
